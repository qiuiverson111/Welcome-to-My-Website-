        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Iverson Qiu, and I am currently a 4th-year student at Northeastern University majoring in Finance and minoring in Data Science. 
            I am on track to graduate in May of 2025, and I’m super excited for that milestone! 
            I have a deep passion for financial markets, math finance, and capital market subjects, and I enjoy performing financial analysis. 
            I am currently on the job search for careers in investment management or internal finance roles like FP&A or corporate finance. 
            I chose to combine data science with finance because I love how mathematics and data analysis intersect in these fields, and it’s something that truly excites me!
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve gained valuable experience working in corporate settings. My first co-op was at Wellington Management, and my second co-op was at Helmsman Financial Strategies. 
            These experiences have further solidified my interest in finance and capital markets. Beyond finance, I also have a strong love for history, as I find it fascinating to understand how past events shape the world we live in today.
            Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I am a very active person. I played varsity soccer and track throughout high school for four consecutive years. While I still enjoy intramural soccer here and there, I’m currently very into basketball and lifting! 
            I hope this gives you a good picture of my interests and lifestyle! Let me know if you’d like to connect or discuss anything further
