    <h1> Hello! My name is Iverson Qiu, and I am a 4th-year student at Northeastern University, majoring in Finance and minoring in Data Science. 
        I’m on track to graduate in May 2025, and I’m incredibly excited about this next chapter in my life. 
        I have a deep passion for financial markets, math finance, and capital market subjects, and I love using data analysis to uncover insights and solve complex problems. 
        I’m currently exploring career opportunities in investment management or internal finance roles, such as FP&A or corporate finance, where I can combine my analytical skills with my interest in finance.  
        Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a strong love for history, as I find it fascinating to understand how past events shape the world we live in today. 
        I also enjoy cooking, which has become one of my favorite hobbies. Cooking allows me to be creative and experiment with different flavors and cuisines. 
        Whether it’s trying out a new recipe or perfecting a classic dish, I find the process of cooking both relaxing and rewarding. 
        It’s also a great way to bring people together, and I love sharing meals with friends and family.  
        In addition to cooking, I’m a very active person. I played varsity soccer and ran track throughout high school, and while I still enjoy intramural soccer occasionally, I’m currently passionate about basketball and lifting. Staying active helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle and keeps me energized for my academic and professional goals.  
        I hope this gives you a good sense of who I am—someone who is passionate about finance, history, cooking, and staying active. Let me know if you’d like to connect or discuss anything further!</h1>
